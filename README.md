## SMS Gateway Code Challenge

âœ… Executed based on assessment guidelines:

- Used GO version: 1.24
- Used PostgreSQL Database
- Designed Hexagonal Architecture
- SMS Provider Mocked and Integrated
- Dockerized via Dockerfile and Docker Compose
- Initialized by Makefile and make command
- Send SMS to optional Mobile number by API
- List of sent messages(sent messages report)
- Increase credit to send message per tenant
- Shared received `Send Message` requests between `Kafka` topics
- `Normal` and `Express` SMS segregated
- Checks messages length count and price amount to avoid send with no credit
- The credit transactions list (increase credit balance/decrease credit per sent SMS)

---

## Overview

### Service:

1. First, create a tenant that has `create`, `detail`, and `list` APIs
2. The `Tenant` balance shown in `Detail` 
3. Use the Tenant `UUID` in all other requests' headers
4. Increase the `Credit` to send SMS(Use the `list` API to trace transactions)
5. Send SMS via Message API. Its status is available by `list` API

### Flow:

By send message, the `Transactional Outbox` will prepare a copy of desired message to handle its `sending` flow
by sharing the message across the `Kafka` topics and the `goroutine workers` support the process in background.
It has the `retry` and `dead-letter queue` to guarantee the sending and achieve the final state.

- The logs are handled in 3 levels of `Terminal Stdout`, `File` and `Logstash(ELK)`. 
- The `Mocked SMS Provider` traced by `Opentelemetry` and `Jaeger`
- The `Kafka` topics progress are available by `Kafka-UI`
- The APIs are available by `Swagger(OpenAPI)`
